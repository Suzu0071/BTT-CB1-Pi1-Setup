The CB1 and the Pi1 are pretty much the same thing, so they use all the same software. And since it's not a raspberry pi chip, you'll have to use the images provided by BTT.

## Pi Imager
First, you'll need to download Raspberry Pi imager from [here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-imager/releases). The screenshots in this guide are of v1.8.5 but other versions shouldn't be too different. Download and install it.
